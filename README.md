# Expo CLI Android Build Failure: AGP Version or Dependency Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android APKs using the Expo CLI. The problem stems from conflicts related to the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version or inconsistencies within project dependencies.  The error messages produced are often vague, making diagnosis and resolution challenging.

## Problem Description

The Expo build process fails, generating error messages that usually hint at AGP version mismatches or problems with dependencies defined in `build.gradle` files. These messages often lack specifics, hindering the debugging process.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully checking and adjusting the following:

1. **AGP Version Compatibility:** Ensure your AGP version is compatible with Expo's requirements.  Check Expo's documentation for the recommended AGP version.  You may need to adjust your `build.gradle` file accordingly.
2. **Dependency Resolution:** Examine your `build.gradle` files for dependency conflicts.  Use tools like `./gradlew app:dependencies` to analyze your dependency tree. Look for conflicting versions of libraries or transitive dependencies.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:**  A simple clean and rebuild can sometimes resolve transient issues.  Run `expo prebuild --clean` and then retry the build.
4. **Check for Outdated Packages:** Make sure all your project dependencies (including Expo itself) are updated to their latest versions.
